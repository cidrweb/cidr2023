			<h2>CIDR 2023 Registration</h2>
			<A NAME="Venue"></A>
			<h3>Venue</h3>

<p>
CIDR 2023 will be held from Sunday, January 08, 2023, to Wednesday, January
11, 2023, in the Mövenpick Hotel Amsterdam City Centre, Piet Heinkade 11,
1019 BR Amsterdam, Netherlands.

			<A NAME="Zoom Registration"></A>
			<h3>Zoom Registration (free)</h3>
<p>
As there turned out to be only a handful of paid Zoom registrations, we decided to reimburse these and to downgrade our AV setup, as this can be expensive.
</p>
<p>

<h3>Interaction in the Q&A session</h3>
<p><strong>Audio setup:</strong> your microphone is muted by default and cannot be unmuted unless requested by an organizer. The organizers will unmute speakers and will moderate the discussion in the Q&A session.</p>

<p>To ask a question:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Raise your hand using the <emph>"Raise Hand"</emph> feature and, if possible, turn on your camera.</li>
					<li>When your question is coming up, an organizer will ask you to unmute.</li>
					<li>Accept the invitation to unmute.</li>
					<li>Ask your question and engage in the discussion. Do not mute your microphone yet.</li>
					<li>Once the discussion is finished, mute your microphone.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Zoom Audience</h3>
					<p>You can use the Zoom chat to submit questions during a presentation. The Zoom moderators will
						either ask the question on your behalf or (preferably) tell you to ask your question live
						according to the process described above.
						The choice depends on the preference of the speaker and session chair. Note that remote
						questions will be interspersed with questions from the in-person audience.</p>

			
			<A NAME="Registration"></A>

In case you have any questions regarding the registration, please (first)
carefully read the detailed information below and (only then) feel free to contact
Stefan Manegold (CIDR Local Arrangements) via email (<em>first-dot-last-at-cwi-dot-nl</em>).

<p>
<em>

3 nights of accommodation in the Mövenpick Hotel, as well as all meals during the

<br>
(Registration for remote attendance via Zoom might open at a later point in time.
 Please be aware, though, that <em>all presenting authors are required to attend CIDR 2023 in-person on-site in
 Amsterdam</em>.)

<!--
<p>
The first week of registration will be open only for (co-)authors of
accepted CIDR-2023 contributions (papers, abstracts, demos).
-->

<p>
Papers at CIDR are expected to be presented by an experienced author; the
form will ask to indicate which paper(s) are authored plus speaker
information.
<p>
Students have a reduced price, as indicated in the form (i.e., EUR 100.-
lower).

<p>
At this time, partial day registration and off-site registration are not
options.  You must register for all three days of the conference.  If you
really need to, you can check-in after Sunday January 08 or check-out before
Wednesday January 11 --- please specify so in your registratin for ---,
however, the total registration fee remains the same.

<p>
Participants may also arrive up to 3 nights before the conference or stay up
to 3 nights afterward and will be charged the Mövenpick guest rate we
negotiated for the conference.  That rate includes accommodation, taxes and
breakfast, but no other meals.  These optional extra days can be specified
in the registration form.

<p>
The registration offers the choice of three room types: (1) <b>single room</b> (one
attendee), (2) <b>double room</b> (one attendee and one non-attending
guest/companion), (3) <b>shared room</b> (two attendees sharing a room).  All fees
are per attendee.  Fees for double room include accommodation and breakfast,
only, for one guest/companion per room/attendee.  Guest/companions cannot
take part in any conference activities or meals (coffee breaks, lunches, dinners).
For shared rooms, please specify your roommate during the registation process.

<p>
The registation allows you to specify dietary restrictions (if any).  We'll
forward this information to the hotel to adjust their meals accordingly as
far as possible.

<p>
You may cancel your registration for a full refund (minus a EUR 100.- fee)
<em>before Thursday, December 22, 2022</em>. After that date, no refunds will be made.

 <h2>Amsterdam Data Science Event</h2>

<p>
Directly after the conference, on Wednesday January 15 15:00-17:30, there will be a special meetup of <a href='https://amsterdamdatascience.nl/'>amsterdamdatascience.nl</a> very near the CIDR venue, with three speakers among whom Michael Stonebraker and Christopher Re from the CIDR community. This event for the community of local data scientists and academics, will be free to attend; also for CIDR attendees. We thought that maybe this is interesting to know for your planning. As mentioned, it is possible to stay extra nights in the hotel.

  <A NAME="VisaInformation"></A>
  <h2>Visa Information</h2>

<p>
Please consult this website: www.netherlandsandyou.nl to see whether you
need a visa to enter The Netherlands, and apply well in advance if you need
one.
<p>
We provide visa invitation letters to data management research/industry
community members, or anyone who will credibly attend CIDR 2023.  Please
contact
CWI secretary Martine Anholt Gunzeln by email (<em>M-DOT-Anholt-DOT-Gunzeln-AT-cwi-DOT-nl</em>)
<!--Stefan Manegold (CIDR Local Arrangements) via email (<em>first-dot-last-at-cwi-dot-nl</em>)-->
to apply for this service.  Please indicate in the email which
accepted CIDR 2023 contribution (paper/abstract/demo) you are an author of
and whether you will present it yourself.
If you are not an author, please explain your connection with CIDR 2023 or
the data management research or industry community, if that is non-obvious.
Please also indicate your professional affiliation as relevant for CIDR.
We may ask you to register and pay for the conference first (in case the
visa is denied, we would refund).
<p>
Some additional remarks:

<ul>
  <li>Most CIDR 2023 attendees would be interested in a short-stay visa, type
 business - this matches the conference invitation letter.</li>
  <li>When the visa application form asks for a contact person, this would be
 Martine Anholt Gunzeln <!--Stefan Manegold--> of CWI.  You can find address and phone number on
 the letterhead of your invitation letter.</li>
  <li><!--Martine tries-->We try to handle invitation letter requests quickly, it should take
 just 2-3 business days.</li>

 <li>The visa application process is organized differently, depending on where
 you live.  This sometimes includes third parties (e.g., in the USA, it is
 handled by an organization called vfsglobal).  Therefore, please carefully
 read and follow the instructions on the NetherlandsAndYou website
 mentioned above, which is the official one from The Netherlands.  Its
 starts by asking you from where you are applying.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Note for applicants resident in the USA: It has been reported that the web
system of vfsglobal shows no appointments available.  Please call
+13473292738 or email them on netherlands.usa@vfshelpline.com if you hit
this issue.
